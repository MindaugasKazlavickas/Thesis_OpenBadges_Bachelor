\section{TECHNOLOGY REVIEW}

To achieve the goal of the work, necessary design, gamification and game elements have to be identified, to develop an educational website that applies gamification principles to teach and drive recognition for open badges. 
While there is no exact example in the industry to follow for achieving this task, existing solutions of education and gamification applied in learning, digital badge systems will be reviewed, highlighting their core gamification features, similarities, and theories applied.

To develop the task, technology and software solutions will be reviewed for the website. 
Finally, the completion of the website's content is intended to reward the user with an open badge of their own. 
This means that an open badge creation pipeline solution has to be explored, alongside metadata creation and its content to provide the website users with a token of verifiable completion that can be interoperably used across the Web.

\subsection{Review of Existing Similar Solutions}
Existing similar solutions will be reviewed to identify key features, gamified elements, and theoretical strategies relevant to designing them. For the purposes of the project, the only concern is with educational, gamification and open badge integrations. 
The analysis will focus on platforms utilizing features such as badges, progress tracking, and leaderboards and the approach to their design to identify key elements and features to be implemented. 
To provide depth, theoretical frameworks like \acrshort{sdt}, \acrshort{mda} Framework, flow theory and alternative approaches will be explored in their application to these platforms. 
This review will adopt a comparative analysis approach, organizing findings into four core criteria: platform name, gamification approach and features, theoretical foundations or strategies applied, and relevance to project goals. 
Aspects like Target Audience, Accessibility, strengths and weaknesses as well as many other potential outlines will be ignored due to being considered out-of-scope for the project. 
Additionally, the selected products and services to-be-reviewed vary significantly in scope and application, so expanding the set of criteria to evaluate would lead to misrepresentation of certain criteria aspects.
By examining how these solutions address engagement and skill recognition, the review aims to conclude elements and strategies to inform the design of a gamified educational website about open badges.

Platforms Mozilla Open Badges, and Open Badge Factory, which provide standardized badge creation and management systems are both viable options for issuing the work-related open badges for the purposes of the project. 
Badgr seems like a great addition that could go on to improve the experience with simple extra digital badges to explain the difference between digital and open badges. 
These systems align with the goal of the project for open recognition of the final badge and digital achievement recognition.

Gamified applications like Duolingo, Classcraft, and Habitica are focused on incorporating interactive elements such as streaks, quests, progress trackers and experience points to motivate users. 
By applying \acrshort{sdt}, these platforms effectively enhance intrinsic motivation through autonomy and competence (\cite{sdt}). 
Their emphasis on visual progress tracking and driving engagement highlights the importance of user-friendly interfaces for sustained participation. 
Duolingoâ€™s gamified elements have been shown to increase user engagement and retention rates significantly.

Educational platforms Khan Academy and Coursera have developed personalized learning paths, mastery-based progress tracking, and social learning. 
These features are rooted in mastery learning, constructivist approaches, and active learning principles, which suggests the importance of personalized educational experiences that balance challenge and skill to maintain user engagement, per the flow theory (\cite{flow}, \cite{powerFeedback}). 
Unfortunately, personalizing learning paths and creating extensive social learning opportunities would not be viable for the project due to being considered out-of-scope for both aspects. 
Kahoot! and Classcraft emphasize collaborative and competitive learning, team-based interactions and real-time participation to encourage both individual and group achievements. 
While team-based interactions are also considered out-of-scope for the project, there is the opportunity to implement the playfulness of presenting educational content like they are done in both of these platforms to improve the user experience.

Overall, the findings suggest that combining the structured credentialing of open badge systems with the engaging, user-centric design of gamified platforms can create an intuitive framework for motivated learning. 
These strategies and practical insights will serve as the foundation for designing an educational platform that integrates gamification and achievement recognition to drive both user engagement and educational outcomes.

\subsection{Technology Review}

\begin{enumerate}
  \addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip} 
  \item {Gamification and Motivation.} \acrshort{sdt}, flow theory and \acrshort{mda} will be applied for the design of the gamified website, in the forms of progress tracking, leaderboard (completion time) and rewards (the digital and open badges)(\cite{sdt}, \cite{flow}).
  \item {Open Badges and Digital Credentialing.} Digital badges will be created and issued using international metadata standards outlined by the Mozilla Open Badges. 
  A pursuit to create them through automatic means will then be made, whether with one of the available tools (Mozilla Open Badges, Badgr, Open Badge Factory).
  \item {User Experience and Interface Design.} A user interface will be implemented for user flow and driving user engagement. 
  The standard goal for the user interface will be a successful application of \acrshort{fbm} (\cite{fogg}), which is focused on three key factors: motivation, ability and triggers. 
  Simplicity is crucial to \acrshort{fbm}  to reduce friction and drive user engagement. 
  To further illustrate this, Figure \ref{fig:foggChart} \footnote{https://behaviormodel.org/} shows that specifically a balance of the three barriers is necessary. 
  So by making the platform more approachable and visually appealing, minimising barriers and using user-centric design, it is possible to improve learning follow-through.
  \item {Responsive Web Design.} The website will be designed mobile-first with relevant principles, as that is where most people are likely to experience the content according to \textcite{mobileDesign}.
